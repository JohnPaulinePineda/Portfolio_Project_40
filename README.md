This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_40/) explores the different penalized regression modelling procedures for numeric responses. Using the standard Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression structures as reference, models applied in the analysis which evaluate various penalties for over-confidence in the parameter estimates included the Ridge Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression and Elastic Net Regression algorithms. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models were assessed in terms of their model fit using the r-squared, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics..
